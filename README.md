# oblitus
Ruby walking alone on the beach with Sinatra, making lists.

Oblitus, Latin for "forgetful" is a dynamic web app proudly built with Ruby and Sinatra.

The overall idea is that Oblitus will allow users to log into their account and manage
various lists that they have created.  They will also be able to see previous lists that
they have completed.
